# Remove Choice Offers ✂️🛍️

**Short:** I didn't want AliExpress "Choice" package offers, so I made an unofficial Chromium extension that removes them. 🎉

---

## What it does

- Removes package/choice items on AliExpress pages by targeting the choice image.
- Lightweight and runs only on `*.aliexpress.com` (see `manifest.json`).

## Install (Chromium-based browsers)

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this extension folder.
4. Visit AliExpress and refresh the page — it runs automatically.

## Notes

- This is **unofficial** and not affiliated with AliExpress. ⚠️
- It may break if AliExpress changes their markup... wait for the fix lol

## Files

- `content.js` — removal logic
- `manifest.json` — extension metadata & injection settings

Enjoy — simple, small, and does what it says. ✨
